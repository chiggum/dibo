Acoustic representation of fractals

Check [this](https://github.com/chiggum/dibo/tree/master/src/prelims/videos) out for some cool videos.

# TODOs

- Add superimpose feature to pysynth_b.
- Come up with a mapping from an arbitrary-length array of integers to another fixed-length array of fixed-integers (pysynth inputs) so that resulting tune/sound is a melody. Knowledge about tone of piano keys may be required.
- Automatically generate a cmap that can best represent the icons/quilts.
- Implement the contractive function to plot fractals.
