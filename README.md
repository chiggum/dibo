Acoustic representation of fractals

Check [this](https://github.com/chiggum/dibo/tree/master/src/prelims/videos) out for some cool videos.

# TODOs

- Add superimpose feature to pysynth_b.
- Mapping from an arbitrary-length array of integers to another fixed-length array of fixed-integers.
    - Hasing is a possibility. But then bytes in Hashes must be mapped to keys so that the resulting sound is a melidoy.
        - A database of piano music notes will help to make the assignment.
        - Or a heuristic can be made using knowledge of piano keys.
- Automatically generate a cmap that can best represent the icons/quilts.
- Implement the contractive function to plot fractals.
